    "# Chapter 1: Basics of geological modeling with GemPy\n",
    "***\n",
    "In this first chapter, we will guide through the most important steps of modeling with GemPy on the base of a relatively simple geological model, while introducing essential objects and functions. We will illustrate how to:\n",
    "- import and create input data for modeling in GemPy\n",
    "- return and visualize input data\n",
    "- generate a 3D geological model in GemPy\n",
    "- visualize a model directly in GemPy\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## The example model: Simple stratigraphy and one fault\n",
    "\n",
    "Our synthetic example model is defined to be cubic, with an extent of 2000 m in every direction of the 3D space. Lithologically, it includes five stratigraphic units of sedimentary origin. Here, we list them from top (youngest) to bottom (oldest):\n",

    "- Sandstone (2)\n",
    "- Siltstone\n",
    "- Shale\n",
    "- Sandstone (1)\n",
    "- Basement (undefined, default by GemPy)\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume that these were simply deposited in consequential order and deformed (tilted and folded) afterwards. Additionally, they are displaced by a continuous normal fault.\n",
    "The final modeling results should look somewhat like this, depending on the type of visualization:\n",
    "\n",
    "![2D and 3D visualizations of our example model.](../../docs/readme_images/model_example_duo.png \"2D and 3D visualizations of our example model\")\n",
    "\n",
    "As this example involves a simple sequence of layers and only one fault, it provides an adequate level of complexity to introduce the basics of modeling with GemPy. At the end of this chapter, we will show some model variations and how the modeling workflow has to be adapted accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Preparing the Python environment\n",
    "\n",
    "For modeling with GemPy, we first need to import it. We should also import any other packages we want to utilize in our Python environment.Typically, we will also require `NumPy` and `Matplotlib` when working with GemPy. At this point, we can further customize some settings as desired, e.g. the size of figures or, as we do here, the way that `Matplotlib` figures are displayed in our notebook (`%matplotlib inline`)."

    "## Importing and creating a set of input data\n",
    "\n",
    "The data used for the construction of a model in GemPy is stored in a Python object called `InputData`. \n",
    "\n",
    "In principle, the input data can be stored in the form of a Python [pickle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html). However, module version consistency is required. For loading a pickle into GemPy, you have to make sure that you are using the same version of pickle and dependent modules (e.g.: `Pandas`, `NumPy`) as were used when the data was originally stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "`InputData` can also be generated from raw data that comes in the form of CSV-files (CSV = comma-separated values). Such files might be attained by exporting model data from a different program such as GeoModeller or by simply creating it in spreadsheet software such as Microsoft Excel or LibreOffice Calc.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, all input data is created by importing such CSV-files. These exemplary files can be found in the `input_data` folder in the root folder of GemPy. \n",
    "The data comprises $x$-, $y$- and $z$-positional values for all surface points and orientation measurements. For the latter, poles, azimuth and polarity are additionally included. Surface points are furthermore assigned a formation. This might be a lithological unit such as \"Sandstone\" or a structural feature such as \"Main Fault\". It is decisive to remember that, in GemPy, interface position points mark the **bottom** of a layer. If such points are needed to resemble a top of a formation (e.g. when modeling an intrusion), this can be achieved by defining a respectively inverted orientation measurement.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we generate our `InputData` from CSV-files, we also have to define our model's real extent in $x$, $y$ and $z$, as well as declare a desired resolution for each axis. This resolution will in turn determine the number of voxels used during modeling. Here, we rely on a medium resolution of 50x50x50, amounting to 125,000 voxels. The model extent should be chosen in a way that it contains all relevant data in a representative space. As our model voxels are not cubes, but prisms, the resolution can take a different shape than the extent. We don't recommend going much higher than 100 cells in every direction (1,000,000 voxels), as higher resolutions will become increasingly difficult to compute."

    "We want our geological units to appear in the correct order relative to age. Such order might for example be given by a depositional sequence of stratigraphy, unconformities due to erosion or other lithological genesis events such as igneous intrusions. A similar age-related order is to be declared for the faults in our model.\n",
    "In GemPy, the function *set_series* is used to assign formations to different sequential series via declaration in a Python dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Defining the correct order of series is vital to the construction of the model! If you are using Python 3.6, the age-related order will already be defined by the order of key entries, i.e. the first entry is the youngest series, the last one the oldest. For older versions of Python, you will have to specify the correct order as a separate list attribute \"*order_series*\" (see cell below).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can assign several formations to one series. The order of the units within such as series is only relevant for the color code, thus we recommend to be consistent. You can define this order via another attribute \"*order_formations*\" or by using the specific command *set_order_formations*. (If the order of the pile differs from the final result the color of the interfaces and input data will be different. ?)\n",
    "\n",
    "Every fault is treated as an independent series and have to be at set at the **top of the pile**. The relative order between the distinct faults defines the tectonic relation between them (first entry is the youngest).\n",
    "\n",
    "In a model with simple sequential stratigraphy, all layer formations can be assigned to one single series without a problem. All unit boundaries and their order would then be given by interface points. However, to model more complex lithostratigraphical relations and interactions, the definition of separate series becomes important. For example, you would need to declare a \"newer\" series to model an unconformity or an intrusion that disturbs older stratigraphy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our example model comprises four main layers (plus an underlying basement that is automatically generated by GemPy) and one main normal fault displacing those layers. Assuming a simple stratigraphy where each younger unit was deposited onto the underlying older one, we can assign these layer formations to one series called \"Strat_Series\". For the fault, we declare a respective \"Fault_Series\" as the first key entry in the `set_series` dictionary. We could give any other names to these series, the formations however have to be referred to as named in the input data."
